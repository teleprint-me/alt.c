 * @brief Binary tree data structure.
 *
 * A binary search tree implementation with typical traversal methods and
 * key-value management.
 *
 * Binary-search tree properties:
 * - Each node has a key and value, and pointers to left, right, and parent nodes.
 * - If a child or parent is missing, the pointer is NULL.
 * - The root node has no parent (parent is NULL).
 * - Left child keys are <= parent key; right child keys are >= parent key.
 * - Supports in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree walks.
