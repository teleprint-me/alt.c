 * We assume that a key or value can be either a byte or numerical representation where a byte maybe
 * be literal or symbolic. In the symbolic case, a byte would be char*. This means that int8_t and
 * uint8_t are equivalent to char and unsigned char. This allows us to leverage the builtin types
 * without be burdened by the verbosity of the underlying types. We should expect the user to take
 * responsibility of the memory allocation. The table is simply used as a reference and for lookups.
 * This means the basic operations, insert, search, and delete. For convenience, we can enable
 * clearing the table as well.
 *
 * @note Should probably use signed integers since tables can unintentionally overflow.
 * e.g. int64_t instead of uint64_t which equivalent to size_t. they're all un/signed long. The
 * difference here is that unsigned values can overflow while signed values wrap.
